# alpha-2048

alpha-2048 is a specializied implementation of DeepMind's AlphaZero algorithm, modified to play stochasic single-player games like 2048. This project implements the stochastic AlphaZero algorithm, the 2048 environment, and parallelized training. 

After training the model, the agent is able to score 2048 or higher in the majority of games it plays.

I wrote a long blog post about how it all works [here](jacob.land).

If you want to learn even more about AlphaZero, there's a great Stanford article that goes more in depth [here](https://web.stanford.edu/~surag/posts/alphazero.html). 

## Training the model yourself

I have written a training notebook [training.ipynb](https://github.com/lowrollr/alpha-2048/blob/main/training.ipynb) that should include everything you need to get started, just follow along with the comments I've written regarding setting up hyperparemeters. If you'd like to include your own environment instead of the 2048 environment I've implemented, you may do that as well. 

## 2048 Training Results

TBD
